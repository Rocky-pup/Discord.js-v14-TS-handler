## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Clone handler**: ```git clone https://github.com/Undefined-Developers/Discord.js-v14-TS-handler handler```.
2. **Configure**: Rename `config/config_sample.ts` to `config/config.ts` in config folder.
3. **Customize Configuration**: Fill in the `config.ts` as needed. Don't worry, not all fields are mandatory for initial setup, and defaults work just fine!
4. **Initialization**: Execute ```npm run init``` and await the magic.
5. **Launch**: Once you see `SETUP IS DONE` in the console, you're all set! Start handler with ```npm run start```. Discover more commands in `package.json`.

**Success**: Your bot is now live and ready to engage!

*P.S. Everything was tested on node v22.12.0 and v20.17.0*

## npm run init - Why?
I created this script to simplify and speed up setup, but if your host disallow file writes and/or you can't use scripts, there's manual way:

1. Run ```npm i```. This will install all the required packages
2. Run ```npm i -g pm2```. This will install pm2 so bot will run in background without any consoles open.
3. Create following entries in .env:
- `DATABASE_URL` and paste database link from config
- `BOT_PROCESS_NAME` and paste botName from config
- `TOKEN` and paste bot token from config
- `AUTH_KEY` and paste bridge_authToken from config
- `REDIS` and paste redis link from config
4. Paste following as scripts in package.json:
```
  "scripts": {
    "init": "npm install pm2 -g && npm install && npx tsx utils/init.ts && npx prisma db push && echo SETUP IS DONE",
    "start": "pm2 start --name 'erry_handler' npx -- tsx index.ts && pm2 save && pm2 log 'erry_handler'",
    "restart": "pm2 restart 'erry_handler' && pm2 log 'erry_handler'",
    "stop": "pm2 stop 'erry_handler'",
    "delete": "pm2 delete 'erry_handler' && pm2 save --force",
    "start:cmd": "npx tsx index.js"
  },
```
5. Run ```npx prisma db push```. This will upload schemas to database so it can save data.
6. Init done!
